    "example_txt = \"\"\"Many schools around the world require students to wear uniforms, while others allow free choice of clothing. In my opinion, school uniforms have both advantages and disadvantages, but overall they are more beneficial than harmful.\n",
    "One major advantage of school uniforms is that they promote equality among students. When everyone wears the same clothes, differences in family income are less visible. This can reduce bullying and pressure on students to wear expensive or fashionable clothing. As a result, students may feel more comfortable and focused on their studies rather than on their appearance.\n",
    "Another benefit is that uniforms can improve discipline and school identity. Wearing a uniform helps students feel that they belong to a community and represent their school. This sense of belonging may encourage better behavior, both inside and outside the classroom. In addition, uniforms make it easier for teachers to identify students, which can improve safety during school trips or events.\n",
    "However, there are also some disadvantages to school uniforms. One common argument is that uniforms limit students' freedom of expression. Clothing is often a way for young people to show their personality, and wearing the same outfit every day can feel restrictive. Moreover, buying uniforms can still be expensive for some families, especially if schools require specific suppliers.\n",
    "In conclusion, although school uniforms may reduce personal expression and create some financial burden, their advantages outweigh the disadvantages. By promoting equality, discipline, and a strong school identity, uniforms can create a better learning environment for students. For these reasons, schools should consider maintaining or introducing uniform policies.\"\"\""

      "{'essay': \"Many schools around the world require students to wear uniforms, while others allow free choice of clothing. In my opinion, school uniforms have both advantages and disadvantages, but overall they are more beneficial than harmful.\\nOne major advantage of school uniforms is that they promote equality among students. When everyone wears the same clothes, differences in family income are less visible. This can reduce bullying and pressure on students to wear expensive or fashionable clothing. As a result, students may feel more comfortable and focused on their studies rather than on their appearance.\\nAnother benefit is that uniforms can improve discipline and school identity. Wearing a uniform helps students feel that they belong to a community and represent their school. This sense of belonging may encourage better behavior, both inside and outside the classroom. In addition, uniforms make it easier for teachers to identify students, which can improve safety during school trips or events.\\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages to school uniforms. One common argument is that uniforms limit students' freedom of expression. Clothing is often a way for young people to show their personality, and wearing the same outfit every day can feel restrictive. Moreover, buying uniforms can still be expensive for some families, especially if schools require specific suppliers.\\nIn conclusion, although school uniforms may reduce personal expression and create some financial burden, their advantages outweigh the disadvantages. By promoting equality, discipline, and a strong school identity, uniforms can create a better learning environment for students. For these reasons, schools should consider maintaining or introducing uniform policies.\", 'language_feedback': \"The essay is well-structured and demonstrates a good command of language, grammar, and vocabulary. The ideas are presented clearly and logically, with a balanced discussion of both advantages and disadvantages of school uniforms. The sentence structure is mostly varied and effective, though some sentences could be more concise. For example, the phrase 'both inside and outside the classroom' could be simplified to 'both in and out of the classroom' for brevity. Additionally, the use of 'may' in 'This sense of belonging may encourage better behavior' could be replaced with 'can' for a more assertive tone. Vocabulary is appropriate and varied, though some repetition, such as 'uniforms' and 'school,' could be reduced by using synonyms like 'attire' or 'institution' in places. Overall, the essay is persuasive and well-argued.\", 'analysis_feedback': \"The essay provides a balanced analysis of the topic, considering both the advantages and disadvantages of school uniforms. It effectively highlights the benefits of promoting equality, discipline, and school identity, as well as acknowledging the drawbacks related to limited personal expression and financial burden. The argument is supported by logical reasoning, such as the statement, 'When everyone wears the same clothes, differences in family income are less visible,' which directly links uniforms to reduced socioeconomic disparities. However, the analysis could be deepened by incorporating specific examples or empirical evidence to support claims, such as studies on bullying reduction or student behavior improvements. Additionally, the essay could explore counterarguments more thoroughly, such as addressing whether the restriction on personal expression has long-term impacts on students' self-identity. Including these elements would strengthen the overall argument and provide a more nuanced perspective.\", 'clarity_feedback': \"The essay effectively conveys the main points of the argument, presenting a balanced view of the advantages and disadvantages of school uniforms. It clearly outlines the benefits, such as promoting equality and improving discipline, while also acknowledging drawbacks like limited personal expression and financial burden. The structure is logical, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. However, some language could be more precise. For example, the phrase 'This sense of belonging may encourage better behavior, both inside and outside the classroom' is somewhat vague. It would be stronger if specific examples or evidence were provided to illustrate how uniforms encourage better behavior. Additionally, the sentence 'buying uniforms can still be expensive for some families, especially if schools require specific suppliers' could be expanded to explain why specific suppliers increase costs. To improve clarity, the author could include more concrete examples or data to support claims and ensure each point is thoroughly explained. For instance, providing a statistic on bullying reduction in schools with uniforms or detailing how specific suppliers impact costs would strengthen the argument.\", 'overall_feedback': \"\\n    After analyzing the essay, the following feedback was provided:\\n\\n    Feedback for language/grammar:\\n\\n    The essay is well-structured and demonstrates a good command of language, grammar, and vocabulary.
