## What is Streaming?

**Streaming** is the real-time delivery of data, letting users access content or services instantly—no need to wait for a full download.

In **LLM-based chat applications**, streaming means sending and receiving messages bit by bit as the conversation happens, rather than waiting for the entire response. This enables:

- **Instant feedback:** Users see replies as they’re generated.
- **Smooth, continuous interaction:** Conversations feel natural and responsive.
