## 🔹 What They Are

| Feature     | LangChain                     | LangGraph                                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Core Idea   | Prompt-chaining library       | State machine + graph execution engine                 |
| Purpose     | Quick LLM apps & prototypes   | Production-grade agentic AI & workflows                |
| Design      | Linear chains, bolt-on agents | Built for multi-agent systems & long-running workflows |
| Reliability | Basic, best-effort            | Deterministic, resumable, checkpointed                 |

## 🔹 How They Work

**LangChain:**
- Chains prompts step by step
- Best for simple apps
- Agents are add-ons

**LangGraph:**
- Each step is a **node**, transitions are **edges**
- Supports branches, cycles, parallel execution
- Persistent state with versioning and checkpoints
- Visualize and debug every step

## 🔹 Key Advantages of LangGraph

1. **Deterministic & Inspectable**: Every action is visible and controllable.
2. **Complex Workflow Support**: Branching, loops, subgraphs, parallel tasks.
3. **Persistent State & Recovery**: Pause, resume, or “time-travel” workflows.
4. **Full Observability & Debugging**: Step-by-step logs, execution graphs, replay.
5. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Multiple agents with shared state.
6. **Tool Calling Made Easy**: OpenAI/Anthropic integration, function validation.
7. **Built for Agentic AI**: Long-running agents, iterative workflows.
