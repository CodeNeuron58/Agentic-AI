# LangChain Recap

A concise overview of LangChain, an LLM orchestration framework for building applications with large language models.

---

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework that simplifies the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides abstractions and tools to connect LLMs with external data, APIs, and user workflows.

## Core Concepts

### 1. LLM Wrappers

- **Purpose:** Provide a unified interface to interact with various LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
- **Benefit:** Easily switch between models without changing your application logic.

### 2. Prompt Templates

- **Purpose:** Create reusable and parameterized prompts for LLMs.
- **Benefit:** Standardize and manage prompts efficiently across your application.

### 3. Chains

- **Purpose:** Define pipelines where the output of one step feeds into the next.
- **Benefit:** Compose complex workflows by chaining together multiple LLM calls and tools.

### 4. Tools & Tool Binding

- **Purpose:** Enable LLMs to call external functions, such as APIs, calculators, or database queries.
- **Benefit:** Extend LLM capabilities beyond text generation to interact with the outside world.

### 5. Agents (Early Version)

- **Purpose:** Allow LLMs to reason, select tools, execute actions, observe results, and iterate until a task is complete.
- **Inspiration:** Based on the ReAct (Reason + Act) paradigm.
- **Workflow:**
    1. Reason about the task.
    2. Select an appropriate tool.
    3. Call the tool.
    4. Observe the result.
    5. Repeat as needed.

### 6. Memory

- **Purpose:** Provide conversational memory (short-term) or custom memory using vector stores.
- **Benefit:** Maintain context across interactions for more coherent conversations.

## Summary

LangChain brings together these core concepts to help developers build robust, flexible, and powerful LLM-driven applications with ease.
