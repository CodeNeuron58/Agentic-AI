# Generative AI vs Agentic AI

## Overview

This guide compares two major AI paradigms:
- **Generative AI** – Creates content
- **Agentic AI** – Takes autonomous actions

---

## Generative AI

Generates new content (text, images, code, video) by learning patterns from data.

**Key Features:**
- Reactive, prompt-based interaction
- Pattern recognition and synthesis
- No autonomous action capability
- Examples: ChatGPT, DALL-E, GitHub Copilot

**Use Cases:**
- Content writing and summarization
- Code completion
- Image/video generation
- Chatbots

**Limitations:**
- Short-term memory only
- Cannot execute multi-step tasks independently
- Dependent on user input

---

## Agentic AI

Autonomous systems that plan, execute actions, use tools, and self-improve toward goals.

**Key Features:**
- Independent decision-making
- Multi-step planning and execution
- Tool/API integration
- Long-term memory support
- Feedback-driven improvement

**Use Cases:**
- Software engineering automation
- Research and data gathering
- Business workflow automation
- E-commerce agents
- System monitoring

**Limitations:**
- Requires robust safety controls
- Potential for misaligned actions
- Privacy and accountability concerns

## Comparison

| Aspect | Generative AI | Agentic AI |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Mode** | Reactive | Autonomous |
| **Planning** | Minimal | Advanced |
| **Tool Usage** | Limited | Core capability |
| **Memory** | Short-term | Long-term |
| **Examples** | ChatGPT, Midjourney | AutoGPT, Devin AI |
